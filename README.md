# gno-onboarding-bot

Go Discord bot that automates the test13 validator onboarding lifecycle: candidate intake, evidence submission, reviewer decisions, the GovDAO handoff, and the on-chain role activation once the validator joins the active set. A Google Sheet is the only persistent store — the bot keeps no local database.

## Commands

The bot registers these Discord commands (see `internal/handlers`):

- `/candidate` — candidate intake
- `/submit-request` — evidence submission (one Sheet row per call, including resubmissions)
- request missing info, ask-to-retry, escalate-to-call, approve — reviewer decisions in `#validator-review`. **Approve does not grant the `Testnet Validator` role**: it only moves the candidate to `GovDAO pending` and forwards them to the GovDAO.
- `/harvest` and `/harvest-import` — the end-of-window competency pass (reviewers only); needs the privileged Message Content intent. See [docs/harvest.md](docs/harvest.md).
- `/remove-validator-role` — bulk removes the `Testnet Validator` role from **every** member who has it and DMs each of them the onboarding-reset notice (reviewers only). Takes a required `announcement-link` option, included in the DM. Needs the privileged Server Members intent and the `Manage Roles` permission.

In addition, a background **activation poller** checks the chain's active validator set every `validator_poll_interval` and grants the `Testnet Validator` role (removing the candidate role, advancing the row to `GovDAO approved`, and DMing the candidate) once an approved candidate's validator is admitted to the active set by the GovDAO. The candidate's signing address is derived on the fly from their operator address via the `r/gnops/valopers` realm and matched against the node's `validators` RPC — no extra Sheet column is stored.

## Setup

1. Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml` and fill in the Discord token, guild/channel/role IDs, GovDAO contact, Google Sheet ID/name, and the gno RPC endpoint. `validator_poll_interval` (Go duration, e.g. `"5m"`) is optional and defaults to 5 minutes — it sets how often the activation poller checks the chain's active validator set.
2. Place a Google service account key at `service-account.json` (path configurable via `google_credentials_file`).
3. Edit `templates.yaml` to adjust candidate/reviewer-facing wording — it's loaded at startup, no rebuild needed, but the bot must be restarted to pick up changes.

`config.yaml` and `service-account.json` are gitignored and must never be logged.

The two services below (Google Sheets, Discord) need manual one-time setup beyond filling in `config.yaml` — neither failure mode is obvious from the bot's first error message, so follow these in full on a fresh setup.

### Google Cloud / Sheets setup

1. Create a project at the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), then enable the **Google Sheets API** for it (*APIs & Services → Enable APIs and Services*).
2. *IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Create Service Account*. No project-level role is needed (the "Permissions"/"Principals with access" step can be skipped) — access is granted directly on the Sheet in step 5.
3. Open the new service account → **Keys** tab → *Add Key → Create new key → JSON*. Rename the downloaded file to `service-account.json` and place it at the repo root (it's gitignored — Google's default filename, e.g. `project-name-xxxxxxx.json`, works too if you instead update `google_credentials_file` in `config.yaml` to match).
4. Create or open the Google Sheet:
   - copy its ID from the URL — `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{SHEET_ID}/edit...` — into `sheet_id` (the `gid=` query param is the tab ID, unrelated, ignore it)
   - note the exact tab name into `sheet_name` (default `"Candidates"`)
   - set row 1 to exactly these 13 headers, in order:
     `Candidate | Discord | Status | Challenge submitted | Reviewers | Missing criteria | Decision date | Valoper link | GovDAO status | Moniker | Operator address | Introduction | Review message link`
5. **Share the Sheet** with the service account's `client_email` (the `client_email` field inside `service-account.json`) with **Editor** access. This is the step most likely to be missing — without it, `/candidate-testnet` fails with "Something went wrong recording your application", and the bot's logs (`docker compose logs -f`) will show the exact `googleapi:` error (e.g. `403 PERMISSION_DENIED` if unshared, `404` if `sheet_id` is wrong).

### Discord application setup

1. Create the application at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. **Bot** tab (left menu) → note the bot's **Username**. This is what shows up in the server's member list — it can differ from the application's display name, so don't search the member list for the application name. Under *Privileged Gateway Intents* on this tab, enable **Message Content** (required by `/harvest`) and **Server Members** (required by `/remove-validator-role` to enumerate every member that holds the validator role — without it that one command replies with an error telling the admin to enable the intent; the rest of the bot still runs).
3. **Installation** tab → under *Default Install Settings*:
   - keep **Installation pour une guilde** (Guild Install) checked
   - Scopes: add both `bot` and `applications.commands` — the latter is required for the slash and message-context commands to register
   - Permissions (integer **268520448**):

     | Permission | Why |
     | --- | --- |
     | View Channels | read the channels it posts to |
     | Send Messages | post in `#validator-review`, DM fallback messages |
     | Embed Links | the `/submit-request` notification in `#validator-review` is an embed ([internal/notify](internal/notify)) |
     | Read Message History | resolve the submission embed targeted by the reviewer context-menu commands |
     | Manage Roles | grant `candidate_role_id` on intake; grant `validator_role_id` and remove the candidate role when the validator joins the active set (the activation poller); bulk-remove `validator_role_id` via `/remove-validator-role` |

4. Copy the **install link** shown at the top of that page, open it in a browser, and explicitly pick the target server from the dropdown — easy to authorize into the wrong server if you manage several.
5. Confirm the bot actually joined: open the server's member list and look for the username from step 2.
6. **Role hierarchy** — *Server Settings → Roles* → drag the bot's role **above** `candidate_role_id` and `validator_role_id`. Discord silently rejects `Manage Roles` actions (`HTTP 403, 50013 Missing Permissions`) on any role positioned above the bot's own role in the list, even though the bot holds the `Manage Roles` permission.
7. **Private channel access** — if `validator_review_channel_id` (or any other command-restricted channel) is private, open that channel's own *Permissions* settings and explicitly add the bot's role with View Channel, Send Messages, Embed Links, and Read Message History. A server-wide permission grant doesn't apply to a channel that excludes the bot's role via its own overwrite.

### Restricting commands to a channel/role

The bot does **not** restrict commands programmatically — Discord's command-permissions endpoint rejects bot tokens (`20001 Bots cannot use this endpoint`), it only accepts an OAuth2 Bearer token from a guild admin. So after each deploy where command IDs change (first deploy, or a command renamed), a server admin configures this manually:

1. *Server Settings → Integrations → (this bot)*.
2. For each command, set **Default Permissions** to disabled, then grant the relevant role:
   - `candidate-testnet` → role: none (anyone), channel: `general_chat_channel_id` only
   - `submit-request` → role: `candidate_role_id`, channel: `onboarding_channel_id` only
   - `Request missing info`, `Ask to retry`, `Escalate to call`, `Approve` (message context commands) → role: `reviewer_role_id`, channel: `validator_review_channel_id` only
   - `remove-validator-role` → role: `reviewer_role_id`

## Build & run

```bash
go build ./...
go vet ./...
go test ./...
go run . -config config.yaml
```

## Layout

- `main.go` — loads `config.yaml` and `templates.yaml`, connects to Google Sheets, opens the Discord session, registers the commands.
- `internal/config` — `config.yaml` loader/validator.
- `internal/templates` — loads `templates.yaml` and renders it as Go `text/template`.
- `internal/forms` — modal input validation helpers.
- `internal/rowref` — encodes a Sheet row number + Discord candidate ID into short strings threaded through embed footers and modal `custom_id`s.
- `internal/sheet` — the Sheet schema (15 intake columns A-O plus the harvest assessment columns P-AA) and the Google Sheets API client.
- `internal/notify` — builds/parses the `#validator-review` notification embed.
- `internal/valoper` — reads validator profiles from the on-chain `r/gnops/valopers` realm (to auto-fill `/submit-request` and to derive a candidate's signing address) and the active validator set from the node's `validators` RPC.
- `internal/handlers` — the command handlers plus shared Discord glue (defer/edit ephemeral responses, DM-with-fallback, role checks), and the background activation poller (`activation_poller.go`) that grants the validator role on on-chain admission.

## Testing

Pure-logic packages have unit tests (`go test ./...`). Discord-session-dependent handler code has none — it needs a live Discord session and Google Sheet, so it's verified manually via [MANUAL_TESTING.md](MANUAL_TESTING.md) after any change to `internal/handlers`.

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the invariants the codebase relies on (Sheet-before-role-mutation ordering, one row per submission, closed-DM fallback).
